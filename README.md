# odin-recipes
odin-recipes is a project that will allow me to demonstrate the skills I have learned from the previous lessons.
Personal log:
- learning how to enter my first commit was difficult. Had trouble with the git commit -m "" command. I eventually got it to go through but not sure what I was doing wrong. I think I kept forgetting to add the " at the end
- forgot to commit early and often and forgot to include additional files in the git message
- Self reminder: figure out how to escape the "git commit message section" I kept running into
