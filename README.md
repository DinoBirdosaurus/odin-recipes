# odin-recipes
odin-recipes is a project that will allow me to demonstrate the skills I have learned from the previous lessons.

Personal log:

- re-arranged personal log to conform with git logs
- Changed git commit message editor on vsc. My commits are slightly better now
-Figured out how to exit and edit log config with git config --global core.pager cat and git config --global core.pager less or just press q or z to exit git log
- Learned how to use VSC terminal instead of regular terminal
- Don't forget to save edits before committing
- Forgot the " again at the end of git commit -m ""
- I completely forgot about 'git push'. Don't forget 'git push'
- Self reminder: figure out how to escape the "git commit message section" I kept running into
- forgot to commit early and often and forgot to include additional files in the git message
- learning how to enter my first commit was difficult. Had trouble with the git commit -m "" command. I eventually got it to go through but not sure what I was doing wrong. I think I kept forgetting to add the " at the end
